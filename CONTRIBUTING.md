# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to OTTO, this project might not yet have gained a lot of traction but with the help from people like you we can make it better and more usable for everyone.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Otto is an open source project which lives and grows from contributions from others. Contributions in any way are welcome, be it tutorials, documentation, bug reports, feature requests or code for new functionality. Due to its young and evolving state even support requests are encouraged, as they can help point out flaws and immaturities in our project.

# Ground Rules

 Responsibilities
 * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
 * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
 * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
 * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
 * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Unfortunately we have yet to set up concrete measures for identifying and tagging good first issues. For new contributors it's best to get familiar with the documentation and code and find things you want to improve on your own.


# Getting started

* Anyone can suggest contributions by creating Pull Requests.
* Please make sure your code is not breaking any existing tests, and where sensible adds new tests.

# How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in OTTO, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.


# Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a semi-regular basis.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within a month. After a month we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
